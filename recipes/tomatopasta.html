    <h3>This cherry tomato pasta is so easy and delicious! Try 
        different types of tomatoes for color and flavor. Larger 
        tomatoes may be cut up into smaller pieces to equal a halved
         cherry tomato. Serve with salad and warm bread.</h3>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>4 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
            <li>    ½ cup olive oil
            <li>   ½ cup chopped shallots
            <li>  1 clove garlic, minced
            <li>  1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
            <li>  1 teaspoon white sugar
            <li>  1 teaspoon salt       
            <li>  ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
            <li> ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
            <li>  1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
            <li> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
            <li>  ¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Steps:</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spread tomatoes in a single later in a 9x13-inch 
                baking dish. Add olive oil, shallots, garlic, 
                balsamic vinegar, sugar, salt, pepper, and pepper 
                flakes; toss until tomatoes are coated with oil and 
                seasonings.</li>
            <li>Roast, uncovered, in the preheated oven, stirring 
                occasionally, for 40 minutes.</li>   
            <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water 
                to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, 
                until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. 
                Drain pasta and return to the pot.</li> 
            <li>Remove tomatoes from the oven and stir into the pasta
                 with fresh basil. Top with Parmesan cheese.</li>        
        </ol>
