        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Spray two 8-inch round cake pans with vegetable oil 
                spray.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, sift together flour, salt and 
                baking powder.Set aside.</li>

            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream butter with the sugar until fluffy. 
Add egg and beat well. Add flour mixture alternately with the 
evaporated milk. Fold in vanilla and almond extracts and 1 cup 
chopped figs.</li>

            <li>Divide into two prepared 8-inch round cake pans. Bake in preheated 
oven until cake springs back when lightly touched with a fingertip 
and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 
minutes. Cool cake layers on wire rack.</li>

            <li>To make the filling: In a saucepan, combine 2 cups chopped figs, 
brown sugar, water and lemon juice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat 
to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 20 minutes.
